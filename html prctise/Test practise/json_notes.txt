JSON can't have comments so I'm making some notes here.

JavaScript Object Notation 

A way to represent data respresentation. Used bc it is a small file size to send back and forth
    - Integrates nicely with js 

Important: Most languages have a library/functions to pass json data into objects 

Take the form: 

MUST USE "" for keys, unlike js don't need. Access elemnts like any data type standard
{
    "key": "value", 
    "key2": 3
    "friends": [{
        "name: "Joey",
        "favouriteNumber": 3
    },
    {
        "name: "Grant",
        "favouriteNumber": 3
    },
    ]
}

Create a object from the string returned 
JSON.parse(string_version_JSON)

Make it look easy to read
JSON.prettify(return)
